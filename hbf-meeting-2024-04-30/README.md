### Halvor Næss: _Brain and Creativity_  [[slides](https://github.com/Brain-and-Consciousness/HBF/blob/main/hbf-meeting-2024-04-30/assets/Kreativitet_og_hjernen_hn20240430_ppt.pdf)]



_Motility precedes sensibility_. The brain’s goal is action. _Creativity provides unpredictable knowledge and is based on selectionist processes restricted by the second law of thermodynamics._ 

Professor Næss has had a long career as a neurologist and as a researcher heading several projects on stroke. We are very much looking forward to him sharing his wisdom on how the brain works with us.
