## HBF-meeting-20250121

Hello HBF Members,

Godt Nyttår <img src="./assets/nyttaar.png" width="35" style="vertical-align: middle;">

Here we are, at the start of a new year and a new HBF season, which starts with a BANG: we have the pleasure of hosting:
 
### Bjørn Sætrevik 

with a surprising talk that will give everyone food for thought and fresh results on a popular topic: cognitive dissonance. We hope to see each other again on Tuesday the 21st @ 15.00 in Borgaskaret (Alrek Helseklynge). Everyone most welcome!

#### Title: “A multilab registered report replication of the cognitive dissonance effect”

**Abstract:** The concept of “cognitive dissonance” may be the closest we’ve come to a grand unified theory of how minds operate. Despite its central position, the empirical basis for the phenomenon is surprisingly weak. In this talk, I’ll describe how a multi-lab collaboration I’ve been involved it that has attempted to place the theory on a surer footing. We designed a “constructive replication” intended to demonstrate the effect, to create a seminal experimental paradigm for the effect, and to explore the psychological mechanisms behind it. This ambitious project ended up being even more challenging than expected, as it grew to have over 100 authors from 39 countries, around 5,000 participants, was delayed by a pandemic, and had surprising results. I’ll try to disentangle some of the study design choices, experiences from the research process, and the implications of the findings. The project was designed as a “registered report replication” in order to ensure transparency and rigor, to encourage adversarial input and to counteract publication bias. As this research model may be unfamiliar to some in the audience, I’ll also try to explain and advocate for this approach.

Hilsen,

HBF Teamet

Also, we are honored to have the host of the [Darwin Day 2024](https://darwin.uib.no), Prof. [Eva Jablonka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eva_Jablonka), to give a talk at HBF about robots and consciousness on February 13 (see attached [pdf](./assets/Darwindagen_i_Bergen.pdf) for more information) – More on this soon!


### Talk by Magnus Bendixen Englund
But finally, opening the semester on the 30th and touching on subjects we have discussed earlier, **Magnus Bendixen Englund** tackles the ‘hard problem’ of consciousness, aka ‘the explanatory gap’ and further identifies a ‘meta-gap’ by those who take on various approaches to the gap. Solving the meta-gap should be the focus of consciousness science. 
 
#### Summary
Psychological individual differences (such as cognitive styles) lead to different positions on a central philosophical problem called "the explanatory gap" (also called "the hard problem"). This, in turn, makes different theories of consciousness adopt different explanatory targets for consciousness (access vs. phenomenal consciousness). Different explanatory targets then divide the empirical science into two camps, making consensus very difficult, not least since the philosophical concerns are likely implicit to most scientists. Scientists then arbitrarily pick a theory, much like they would pick a football team, which is likely based on their individual disposition, and not a rational decision. Alternatively, they attempt to make their own theory as they find the current proposals within the field to be unsatisfactory. The result is several dozen active empirical theories of consciousness, and an ocean of methodological issues. In sum, individual dispositions make it so consciousness science cannot reach an agreement on its most central issue, the explanatory gap, which in turn strongly affects how the empirical science is being performed. There is a "gap" between our positions on the explanatory gap, which I call the "meta-gap". Solving the meta-gap should be the focus of consciousness science, and requires other fields (such as psychology and sociology) to intervene. We need a sort of "meta-science", for example, a psychology of consciousness science, which sorts out the dispositional problems and makes us aware of them (ideally, self-aware).
