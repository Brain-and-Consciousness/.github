_Fundamental research in science is being transformed by a practice predominantly associated with the arts: namely hallucinations._


This rapid [artist] overview of **key scientific AI examples** (that covers a year loosely defined as starting with the release of GPT-4 on March 14th, 2023) is framed by the hypothesis that fundamental research in science is being transformed by a practice predominantly associated with the arts: namely hallucinations. Hallucinations in people are conventionally associated with mental illness, drugs, and/or genius. Hallucinations in AI (mostly in large language models) have been critiqued as net-negatives: contributing to disinformation, bias, post-truth, deep-fakes, collapse of democracy, copyright theft, etcâ€¦ Yet at the same time, AI hallucinations (of proteins/crystals/algorithms/circuits etc) pruned down to the feasible, are contributing to a revolutionary acceleration of scientific discoveries in numeric-algorithmic optimizations, AI hardware accelerators, reward mechanism design, non-invasive brain sensors, drug discovery, sustainable deep-tech materials, autonomous lab robotics, neuromorphic organoid computing, and mathematical reasoning. In both art and science, hallucinations are almost enough: without the pruning down to the plausible, there is just a sprawl of potentiality.

Based on the enormous mountain of links collected 2023-2024 in the [gdoc AI Spring](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qlX4UGrjkdMguL9PMEtm9Mp7PYHrTmMCFqnshOeA-xw/edit?usp=sharing), this is currently a 40-45 minute talk that will be released in next iteration as an essay, and eventually perhaps as a video.<br>


**David Jhave Johnston** is a digital-poet writing in emergent domains: A.I., 3D, VR, and code. Author-programmer of the multimedia human + A.I. writing art-project [_ReRites_](http://glia.ca/rerites) (Anteism Books, 2019), the theoretical-history [_Aesthetic Animism: Digital Poetry's Ontological Implications_](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262034517/aesthetic-animism) (MIT Press, 2016), and many online multimedia literary-art explorations at [www.glia.ca](http://www.glia.ca). He is currently employed as an Ai-narrative researcher at the UiB [_Centre for Digital Narrative_](https://www.uib.no/en/cdn) from August 2023-26 on a team investigating _Extending Digital Narrative_.
