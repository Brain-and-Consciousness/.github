## HBF-meeting-20240130

**Subject: HBF season opening // Social gathering**

Happy new year everyone!
 
It is with great pleasure we announce that HBF will have its first events of the semester 30th of January. Two things will be happening:
 
First a talk at 1500 in Borgaskaret - Alrek,<br>
Second by a social gathering at 1900 generously hosted at the home of Astri and Arvid 1800 at Haugeveien 11 - Nordnes (see attached file for more info about this beautiful location). I will be ordering pizza from don Stefano (and we do a Vipps settlement: please email me for any dietary requirements) for anyone interested in that. You can bring your own favorite drink(s)!
 
Please sign up for one or all of these events here: https://skjemaker.app.uib.no/view.php?id=16396169
 
Also, of we are honored to have the host of the [Darwin talk](https://darwin.uib.no) to HBF about robots and consciousness at February 13 (see attached [pdf](./Darwindagen_i_Bergen.pdf) for more information) – More on this soon!


### Talk by Magnus Bendixen Englund
But finally, opening the semester at 30th and touching on subjects we have discussed earlier, **Magnus Bendixen Englund** tackles the ‘hard problem’ of consciousness, aka ‘the explanatory gap’ and further identifies a ‘meta-gap’ by those who take on various approaches to the gap. Solving the meta-gap should be the focus of consciousness science. 
 
**Summary**<br>
Psychological individual differences (such as cognitive styles) lead to different positions on a central philosophical problem called "the explanatory gap" (also called "the hard problem"). This, in turn, makes different theories of consciousness adopt different explanatory targets for consciousness (access vs. phenomenal consciousness). Different explanatory targets then divide the empirical science into two camps, making consensus very difficult, not least since the philosophical concerns are likely implicit to most scientists. Scientists then arbitrarily pick a theory, much like they would pick a football team, which is likely based on their individual disposition, and not a rational decision. Alternatively, they attempt to make their own theory as they find the current proposals within the field to be unsatisfactory. The result is several dozen active empirical theories of consciousness, and an ocean of methodological issues. In sum, individual dispositions make it so consciousness science cannot reach an agreement on its most central issue, the explanatory gap, which in turn strongly affects how the empirical science is being performed. There is a "gap" between our positions on the explanatory gap, which I call the "meta-gap". Solving the meta-gap should be the focus of consciousness science, and requires other fields (such as psychology and sociology) to intervene. We need a sort of "meta-science", for example, a psychology of consciousness science, which sorts out the dispositional problems and makes us aware of them (ideally, self-aware).
